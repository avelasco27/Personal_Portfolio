                                    days when students to not talk to me. Besides my purpose of the 
                                    job is to keep control of my classroom. It makes me smile when students
                                    ask me question about what I am studying, or there ask for college advice
                                    and I get to share advice I wish someone told me before I began college.

                                    My first job after high school was being a referee at my local paintball field business. Even though it was 
                                    simple job I gain skills in customer service. This job help me get 
                                    out of the social bubble and speak to people. I supervised up to 3 games at a time to ensure 
                                    customers play fairly and safely. While working here I demonstrated the highest level of responsiblility, 
                                    good teamwork, and trustworthiness among my peers which resulted in being selected as 
                                    employee of the month 5 times in a row. Something I was proud of myself while working here 
                                    was being able to run the business for a whole day by myself with only 4 days of working there.
